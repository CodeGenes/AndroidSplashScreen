# AndroidSplashScreen
This is how you can create your Android splash screen.

When your app is launched by user, it will show some white or black screen briefly before the main screen is shown. 
This is beause it will take a few milliseconds to be loaded into memory and the onCreate() method to be called. This brief white or black screen is your splash screen. Most of Google apps will show you the google logo before the main app is opened fully. This is considered a good design because users might think the app has frozen especially if your takes longer to initialize and this might be a put off leading to uninstalls.

</div>

Thanks!
